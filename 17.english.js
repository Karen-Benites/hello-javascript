let name = 'Amy'
let text =`Hello ${name}, great job!
Here are some tips to improve:
- In "My name is ${name}. I am ${name}." You only ose ONE phrase, no need to use the two phrases at the same time: My name is ${name}, OR, I am ${name}`
let text2 = `Hello ${name}, excellent job! keep going like this!`

console.log(text)
